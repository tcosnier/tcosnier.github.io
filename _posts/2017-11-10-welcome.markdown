Hi there, my name is Thibault. I'm an engineer with advanced qualifications in the field of materials physics and science. I'm currently working at CEA LETI research facility in Grenoble (France) where I conduct a PhD on III-Nitrides (III-N) power devices. My research is focused mainly on the engineering of mechanical stress fields in AlGaN/GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs).

This brand new website is intended to host an interactive version of my resume as well as articles on differents topics (technology, books, etc.). Stay tuned.
