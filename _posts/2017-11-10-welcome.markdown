Hi there, my name is Thibault. I'm an engineer with advanced qualifications in the field of materials physics and science. I'm currently working at CEA LETI research facility in Grenoble (France) where I conduct a PhD on III-Nitrides (III-N) power devices. My research is focused mainly on the engineering of mechanical stress fields in AlGaN/GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs).

This brand new website should embrace several purposes :

* hosting my resume (interactive html version and .pdf version) 
* showcasing some of my projects
* writing articles on topics that matters to me

Stay tuned.
